==================

Datastore files for the Perdix IRC bot Transformation module.

Pull requests are accepted and expected >:)

These files are fed into the Perdix IRC bot to power its random Transformation module. Files are formatted one option per line, with an optional pipe-delimited multiplier. Lack of multiplier (and pipe) presumes a multiplier of one. Multiplier effectively causes that option to be present in the list of possible choices multiple times.

Some of the content in these files may not be work safe; all trigger warnings should be presumed.
